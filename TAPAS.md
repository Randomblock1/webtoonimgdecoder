# Tapas

Tapas is similar to Webtoon in that they try not to just store ordered JPEGs. While Webtoon stores everything in a nice order, only xor'ing the files slightly, Tapas renames the files in a seemingly random order and stores the order as a list in tapas_room.db.

Additionally, while Webtoon episodes can be got without root, Tapas stores its stuff in /data/data/com.tapastic. However, it's trivial to create an emulator with ADB root access.

The JPEGs are stored at `/data/data/com.tapastic/files/contents_v2/seriesId/chapterId/`. They are named weirdly, like `[Ljava.lang.Object;@9596b32`, but they are not encoded. You just have to change the extension to `.jpg`, and it will work. However, that's not much use if they're all out of order (which they are).

Luckily, the SQLITE database at `/data/data/com.tapastic/databases/tapas_room.db` has every file ordered in a table called `download_episode`. In order to rename these to their correct filename (1.jpg, 2.jpg etc...) we simply need to read a `fileUrl` field, and match the files. For every match we get in one chapter, we rename the file to a counter that goes up.

Unfortunately, the chapters aren't separated by rows. But since it provides a full path, all we need to do is rename the beginning to a specified folder, and everything should work.
