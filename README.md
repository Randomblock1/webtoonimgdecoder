# Webtoon Image Decoder

## Decodes downloaded chapters from the Webtoon app

When you download a chapter from the Webtoon app (on Android), the JPGs are accessible at `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.naver.linewebtoon/files/episode_download`.

But they can't be opened as JPG files! That's because the first 8 bits been XOR'd (bit flipped) to corrupt the magic number and confuse image software. (I know this sounds like nonsense but trust me it's real).

This Python script simply takes a folder as input, searches for JPGs, and decodes them by XOR'ing them again, skipping valid JPGs. GIFs and audio files are likely also encoded like this, but I haven't tested it so this script avoids them entirely.

## Usage

Setup only needs to be done once.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, point the script at the image download folder (more on this below).

`python3 decoder.py path/to/images`

It works _fast_! It processes 5409 images in only 9.7 seconds. Plus, it skips over already valid files; it only takes 0.8 seconds to check and skip over 5409 images.

## Getting the JPGs

1. Through the Android Webtoon app, download any chapters you want to save.

2. Install ADB on your computer.

3. Enable ADB debugging on your phone and connect your phone to your computer.

4. Open up a terminal and run this command:

   `adb pull /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.naver.linewebtoon/files/episode_download output`

Done. All the data will be stored in the `output` folder. All you need to do is run `python3 decoder.py output` and wait.

## TODO

Add support for music and GIFs. They're probably also encoded like this, but I'm not sure and I haven't checked.
